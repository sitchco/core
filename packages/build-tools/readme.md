# Sitchco WordPress Platform Tooling

## 1. Vision & Goals

The **Sitchco WordPress Platform** provides a **modern, scalable** WordPress foundation for multiple client sites and distribution scenarios. The core objectives remain:

-   A **Must-Use (MU) plugin** (`sitchco-core`) acting as “platform core” logic.
-   A **parent/child theme** structure ensuring consistent front-end and inheritance-based workflows.
-   A **modular approach** segmenting features (blocks, components, UI patterns) into “modules,” which can be reused across the MU plugin, themes, or standalone plugins, identified by a `.sitchco-module` marker file.
-   A **tooling suite** that unifies linting, formatting, testing, and building for JavaScript, Sass, SVG, and other assets.

A key consideration is ensuring **flexibility** for different build contexts:

-   **Composer `prefer-dist`** mode, where packages include only compiled assets (and no source markers).
-   **Composer `prefer-src`** or direct monorepo development, where all source files are editable, and local watchers can be run in each package/theme.

We also acknowledge the possibility of **lightweight frontend frameworks** like Alpine.js for minimal interactivity, or React/Vue for more complex scenarios, but we don’t intend to force heavy frameworks on simple components.

## 2. Technology Stack

The platform’s tooling leverages:

-   **Node.js (>=18)** and **pnpm** (with workspace support for managing internal packages).
-   **Vite** for fast JS/CSS bundling and development server.
-   **`laravel-vite-plugin`**: Integrates Vite with PHP environments, handling manifest generation, hot module replacement (HMR) detection via a `hot` file, and asset URL generation.
-   **`sass-embedded`**: For compiling Sass/SCSS stylesheets.
-   **ESLint** (with `@sitchco/eslint-config`) for JavaScript linting.
-   **Prettier** (with `@sitchco/prettier-config`) for code formatting.
-   **Terser**: Used within `dev-scripts` for JavaScript formatting/optimization.
-   **SVGO**: Used within `dev-scripts` for SVG optimization/formatting.
-   **Vitest**: For unit and integration testing of tooling packages and JavaScript components.
-   **Changesets** (optional): For managing versioning and changelogs within the monorepo.

## 3. Monorepo & Package Structure

The shared build tooling resides within the **sitchco-core** MU plugin in a dedicated `packages/` folder. This centralizes build logic while allowing dependent projects (like child themes) to remain editable. In Composer **`prefer-dist`** mode, the MU plugin, plugins, and parent theme are installed as dependencies without marker files. The child theme(s) in the main project repository retain their `.sitchco-module` marker files, enabling local development builds.

```

│       └── ... (other sitchco-core files)
├── themes/
│   ├── sitchco-parent-theme/            # Composer dependency (no marker files in dist mode)
│   └── sitchco-child-theme/             # Main project repo (contains marker files)
└── plugins/
└── (Other plugins as Composer dependencies)
```

This structure ensures that while core platform elements are managed as dependencies, the primary development target (e.g., the child theme) uses the tooling via its marker file for local asset processing.

## 4. Core Tooling Packages

The key tooling packages under `sitchco-core/packages/build-tools/` provide:

-   **`@sitchco/project-scanner`**
    Responsible for discovering “Sitchco modules” by locating `.sitchco-module` marker files. It identifies module roots, entry points (JS/MJS/SCSS in standard locations like `assets/scripts`, `assets/styles`, `blocks/...`), finds the WordPress web root, locates source files by extension, and can clean build artifacts (`dist/`, `.vite/`). Its findings are used by other tooling packages.

-   **`@sitchco/module-builder`**
    Provides CLI commands (`module-builder build`, `module-builder dev`, `module-builder clean`). It uses `@sitchco/project-scanner` to find asset targets and then orchestrates `vite` (using `laravel-vite-plugin` and `sass-embedded`) to compile assets into the project's root `dist/` folder.
    -   `build`: Creates optimized production assets and a `manifest.json`.
    -   `dev`: Starts Vite's development server with HMR, creating a `hot` file for PHP integration.
    -   `clean`: Removes build artifacts found by the scanner.

-   **`@sitchco/dev-scripts`**
    Offers a unified CLI for code quality (`sitchco-lint`) and formatting (`sitchco-format`). It wraps ESLint and custom formatting logic, delegating file discovery (based on extensions within the project) to `@sitchco/project-scanner`.
    -   `sitchco-lint`: Runs ESLint based on the shared config.
    -   `sitchco-format`: Formats/optimizes files using appropriate tools: Prettier, Terser, ESLint (`--fix`) for JavaScript; SVGO for SVG. *(Note: PHP formatting is not currently implemented)*.

-   **`@sitchco/eslint-config` & `@sitchco/prettier-config`**
    These shared configurations standardize code style and formatting rules across all modules and packages, ensuring consistency. They are consumed by `@sitchco/dev-scripts` and can be referenced in project root configurations.

Together, these packages provide a consistent developer experience, supporting flexible builds across different project setups and distribution modes.

## 5. Architectural Principles & Developer Workflow

1.  **Project-Level Builds:**
    -   Build commands (`module-builder build|dev`) are typically run from the **project root** (e.g., the directory containing the child theme or the entire monorepo).
    -   The tooling scans for `.sitchco-module` markers starting from the current working directory.
    -   All discovered assets are compiled into a single `dist/` folder at the project root, along with a `manifest.json` and a `hot` file (in dev mode).

2.  **Flexible Execution Context:**
    -   **Monorepo / Full Source:** Devs run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` from the project root containing multiple source packages (MU plugin, themes, etc.) marked with `.sitchco-module`.
    -   **Client Project / Partial Source:** A client working only on a child theme runs `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` within their project folder (which contains the child theme with its `.sitchco-module` marker). The tooling builds only the assets found within that scope.

3.  **Asset Structure & Manifest:**
    -   Vite (via `laravel-vite-plugin`) manages asset compilation, placing outputs typically in `dist/assets/...` with hashed filenames for cache busting.
    -   A single `manifest.json` is generated in the `dist/` folder, mapping source entry points to their hashed output files.
    -   In development (`dev` mode), assets are served by Vite's dev server (`http://localhost:5173/...` by default), and a `hot` file is created in the `dist/` directory.

4.  **Enqueueing in WordPress:**
    -   A centralized PHP helper class (e.g., `Sitchco\Core\AssetEnqueuer`) is expected to handle asset registration.
    -   This helper should:
        -   Check for the existence of the `hot` file in the `dist/` directory to determine if the Vite dev server is active.
        -   If the `hot` file exists, load assets directly from the Vite dev server URL.
        -   If the `hot` file does *not* exist, read the `dist/manifest.json`.
        -   Use the manifest to map logical asset paths (e.g., `assets/scripts/main.js`) to their final, hashed URLs in the `dist/` folder.
        -   Enqueue scripts and styles using `wp_enqueue_script` / `wp_enqueue_style` with the correct URLs and dependencies.

5.  **Minimal or Advanced JS Frameworks:**
    -   The tooling supports Vanilla JS, Alpine.js, or more complex frameworks like React/Vue on a per-entry-point basis, as Vite handles the bundling.

6.  **Distribution & Client Handoff:**
    -   **Internal Devs:** Work in source mode (`prefer-src` or monorepo), using `pnpm dev`.
    -   **Clients/Agencies:** Receive packages (themes/plugins) typically via Composer in `prefer-dist` mode. Only the necessary PHP files and the compiled `dist/` folder (with `manifest.json`) are included in distributed packages, while the main project repo (e.g., child theme) retains source files and the `.sitchco-module` marker for local development.

## 6. Planned Improvements

While the current tooling provides a solid foundation, we have identified key areas for future enhancement:

-   **TypeScript Conversion:**
    Migrate the core JavaScript-based tooling packages (`@sitchco/project-scanner`, `@sitchco/module-builder`, `@sitchco/dev-scripts`, etc.) to TypeScript. This will improve code maintainability, developer experience through better autocompletion and type checking, and overall robustness.

-   **Comprehensive Testing:**
    Implement a thorough test suite using **Vitest** for all core tooling packages. This includes adding unit tests for individual functions and modules, and integration tests to verify the end-to-end workflows (e.g., scanning, building, linting). This will help ensure reliability, catch regressions early, and provide confidence when making future changes.

## 7. Conclusion

**Sitchco WordPress Platform Tooling** offers a modern development workflow leveraging Node.js (>=18), Vite, `laravel-vite-plugin`, Sass, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and specialized internal packages. The system supports both monorepo development and Composer-based distribution (`prefer-dist`/`prefer-src`). Key features include:

-   **Dynamic Asset Discovery** based on `.sitchco-module` markers via `@sitchco/project-scanner`.
-   **Unified Build Process** (`build`, `dev`, `clean`) orchestrated by `@sitchco/module-builder` using Vite.
-   **Integrated Code Quality** tools (`lint`, `format`) provided by `@sitchco/dev-scripts`.
-   **Seamless PHP Integration** facilitated by `laravel-vite-plugin` for manifest handling and HMR.
-   **Future-proofing** with planned migration to TypeScript and expanded test coverage.

This approach balances performance, developer experience, maintainability, and the practical needs of distributing and developing WordPress projects.
